The following way of showing text could change how we consume news.
(You usually read 200 words per minute.)

The audience is at the heart of everything BBC does. Therefore we could think of no one better to push the boundaries of news consumption. 

Over one third of the Brits feel that having to keep up with today’s information overload leaves them stressed out. This leads to increased levels of cortisol, which can lead to confusion and memory loss.

BBC ____
A new reading experience that helps you build focus through technology.

The solution revolves around speed reading, which ironically works as active meditation. Just like when you’re jogging.

BBC ___ displays one word a time where your brain wants it to be, using something called the ‘’Optimal Recognition Point’’. When your eyes find the word, your brain starts to process the meaning without having to move your eyes.

Reading like this challenges the brain to build focus, which improves your memory and helps you read up to twice as fast.

Adding BBC _______ as a feature on all BBC’s platforms, it can help people consistently train their brains to work faster, wander less and focus more.

By the way you just read 400 words per minute.
